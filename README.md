h1. GELUTILS

Tools and utilities for working with scientific GEL files.

Current features:
* Quickly annotate lanes on gel using sample names from a plain text file.
* Linearize GEL files stored in MD GEL squareroot format (e.g. gel files from Typhoon scanners).


h2. Suggested features what would make this easier to use

Please feel free to write me with bugs or feature suggestions.
Or, even better: Fork this repository, fix the bugs and
implement the features as you want, then send me a pull request :)


h3. GUI(s)
Currently, all utilities are controlled from the command line. 
This is really both the fastest way and my preferred way. And the UNIX way.

And while a GUI could speed up some things (such as defining crop regions 
and adjusting parameters), I doubt that the time saved could ever make
up for the time spent implementing GUIs.
